# Project 2
HDL Code for Some of the fundamental chips required for hardware design of HACK Computer. Main objective to build HACK ALU in this section.
Circuit Diagrams for each chip is given below.


## HACK ALU
HACK ALU will be Arithmetic Logic Unit of HACK Computer, it can perform Addition, Subtraction, Bitwise And, Bitwise Or, Negation, Zero, etc.

## Add16 16bit
Add16 is a chip to add two 16 bit inputs. Built using combination of one Half adder and 15 Full adder.
Overflow bit is ignored.
