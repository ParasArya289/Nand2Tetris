# Project 3
HDL Code for Some of the fundamental chips required for hardware design of HACK Computer. Main objective to build Sequential chips in this section. Sequential circuits rely on clock signal which is generated by an external oscilator. Sequential circuits are fundamental units to design a memory. 
Circuit Diagrams for each chip is given below.


## Bit
Fundamental unit to hold a 1 bit value indefintely. Bit is build using combination of Mux 2:1 and D-Flip Flop.

## Register 16bit
16 bit register is built using 16 Bits components.

## PC (Program Counter)
Built using combination of Register, inc16, and Mux.

## RAM8
RAM unit build with 8 registers. Size of address bit is determined using log<sub>2</sub>n , where n is size of input.
