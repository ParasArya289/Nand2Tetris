# Project 3
HDL Code for Some of the fundamental chips required for hardware design of HACK Computer. Main objective is to build Sequential chips in this section.<br>
Sequential circuits rely on clock signal which is generated by an external oscilator. Sequential circuits are fundamental units to design a memory.<br>
Circuit Diagrams for each chip is given below. Some diagrams are color codded to prevent confusion.


## Bit
Fundamental unit to hold a 1 bit value indefintely. Bit is build using combination of Mux 2:1 and D-Flip Flop.

## Register 16bit
16 bit register is built using 16 Bits components.

## PC (Program Counter)
Built using combination of Register, inc16, and Mux.

## RAM8
RAM unit build with 8 registers. Size of address bit is determined using log<sub>2</sub>n , where n is size of input.

## RAM64
RAM unit build with 8 RAM8 units. contains 64 registers in total. Sub bus for RAM8 is address[0..2] and Mux and Dmux is address[3..5].
